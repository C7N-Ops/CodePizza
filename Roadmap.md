# 🗺️ CodePizza Roadmap

> _“Because even pizza needs a plan — kind of.”_

Welcome to the CodePizza roadmap — a rough guide to where we’re going (and how much cheese we’re using to get there).

---

## 🔥 Stage 1: Preheat (Now)

Set the oven. Check the dough. Yell at Git.

- [x] Brand identity + logo 🍕  
- [x] README, License, Contributing & Code of Conduct  
- [x] Wiki launch + sidebar  
- [x] Project structure and repo scaffolding  
- [x] Banner & receipt-style footer graphics  
- [ ] Launch `codepizza.dev` (splash site / GitHub Pages)

---

## 🍳 Stage 2: Bake (In Progress)

Turn ideas into actual, edible code.

- [ ] Open-source project templates (Node, Python, Static HTML)
- [ ] Spaghetti Code Challenge: Weekly refactor puzzles 🍜
- [ ] CodePizza CLI: `codepizza init`  
- [ ] Meme-based linter or commit hook 😂  
- [ ] Pizza-themed browser extension (why not?)

---

## 🔪 Stage 3: Slice & Serve (Next)

Feed the people.

- [ ] Launch Discord community 🍕 (maybe? If the people want it!)
- [ ] Weekly dev snack newsletter  
- [ ] YouTube: coding + chaos + cheese  
- [ ] Merch (shirts, stickers, stress balls shaped like pizza)

---

## 🚀 Stage 4: The Leftovers (Later)

Ideas that are either genius or grease-fueled nonsense.

- [ ] CodePizza mobile app (100% unnecessary)  
- [ ] AI-generated pizza recipes based on your Git commit history  
- [ ] Pizza-scented QR code for contributors  
- [ ] Live “Bug Bake-Off” stream with guest devs

- [🧠 Menu of Ideas](./Ideas.md)

Or just fork the repo, add some toppings, and PR something weird.

Stay saucy.
