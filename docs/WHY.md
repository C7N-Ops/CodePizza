# 🍕 Why I Teach Tech: From Green Screens to GPT

> _“I don’t fear AI. I fear not understanding it.”_

I’ve been lucky enough to witness four of the most transformative technical revolutions in modern history. I grew up in a world where computers were rare, AI was science fiction, and phones were still tethered to the wall. I’ve seen the future arrive again and again — and every time, it’s changed everything.

## 🖥️ The First Revolution: Personal Computing

I’m old enough to remember when computers weren’t in every home — or every pocket.  
They were giant beige boxes locked in air-conditioned rooms, guarded by people with clipboards.

My first real exposure to tech was the **Apple IIe** — glowing green screens in a school computer lab where we played *Oregon Trail*, learned to type, and quietly became creators in a digital world we didn’t fully understand.

Back then, learning computers wasn’t trendy — it was optional, even weird. But for those of us who stuck with it, it planted something: curiosity, confidence, and a sense of exploration that never really left.

## 🌐 The Second Revolution: The Internet

I was in high school when the internet became real. Dial-up screeches. AIM chat windows. The days before Google — when finding answers meant flipping through encyclopedias or mastering the Dewey Decimal System.

Then everything changed.

Suddenly, the entire world was connected. Information flowed freely. We could publish, build, learn, explore — all from our keyboards. I watched the *dot-com boom*, the *burst*, and the slow, steady rise of *Web 2.0* — and I was hooked for life.

## 📱 The Third Revolution: Mobile & Bitcoin

There was a time when a “handheld phone” meant a chunky cordless landline. But then came mobile.  
Then smartphones.  
Then… *everything changed again.*

I watched in real-time as the world shrank — and our expectations for convenience grew.  
I remember the **first time I used Bitcoin**, not knowing how big it might become.  
It was raw, clunky, unpredictable — but revolutionary.

The power to transfer value, instantly, across the globe… without permission.  
A new kind of digital freedom. A new kind of trust.

## 🤖 The Fourth Revolution: AI

And now, here we are — staring down the barrel of **the AI age**.

I don’t think AI will replace me.  
But I *do* believe someone who knows how to use AI effectively *will*.

This is not the time to retreat or resist.  
This is the time to **learn**, **adapt**, and **teach**.

## 💡 Why I Teach

There are people — young and old — just starting to explore this world.  
And they deserve better than confusion, jargon, or gatekeeping.

They deserve someone who can say:  
> “I’ve been there. Let me show you what I’ve learned.”

That’s why I teach.  
That’s why I build.  
That’s why I created **CodePizza** — not just as a toolset, but as a table anyone can sit at.

## 🧠 The Big Idea

Technology is not just for the brilliant, the elite, or the early adopters.

It’s for the curious.  
It’s for the willing.  
It’s for *everyone*.

And if I can help someone take their first step — whether it’s coding their first loop, deploying their first app, or just understanding how AI works — then I’ve done something that matters.

## 🍕 One Last Slice

So no, I don’t fear AI.  
I fear *missing the moment* to help someone else keep up with it.

And as long as I can write, teach, and build — I’ll keep showing up.

Because the world still needs explorers.  
And every explorer deserves pizza.

**Stay saucy.**
