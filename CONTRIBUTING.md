## So You Wanna Contribute? Great.
First of all—thank you. We appreciate contributors who write code instead of just filing issues that start with "This is broken." You’re already ahead of the game.

Before you start, here’s a short guide to make sure your pull request doesn’t get yeeted into the abyss.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo**
This is Git 101. You break it, you bought it (sort of).

2. **Create a feature branch**
Don’t work off `main` unless you enjoy chaos.
Use a name like `fix-spelling-error` or `add-dark-mode-button-of-doom`.

3. **Do the thing**
Write good code. Comment when necessary. Leave it better than you found it. Basically, don't be the person whose code future-you hates.

4. **Write meaningful commit messages**
`Fixed stuff` is not a meaningful message. Try `Fix null reference in login handler`. See the difference? We do.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
Include a short description of what you did and why it won’t ruin everything.

## 🧪 Tests? Maybe?
If this project has tests, please run them. If it doesn't… pretend it does and at least try not to break things.

## 🤝 Code Style
Follow existing patterns. If the code looks like it was written by a Victorian chimney sweep using Vim over telnet, match that style. Consistency > Perfection.

## ❌ What Not to Do
- Don’t reformat the entire codebase just because your linter yelled at you.
- Don’t submit PRs that include unrelated changes like fixing a typo and rewriting the routing system.
- Don’t argue about tabs vs spaces unless you're trying to get banned for sport.

## 🧙 Bonus Points
- Clear variable names.
- Helpful comments (not just "fixes bug").
- Humor in moderation.
- Self-deprecation in commit messages? Chef’s kiss.

## Final Word
If you’re still reading this, you probably know what you're doing. So fork away, be cool, and let’s make something great.
