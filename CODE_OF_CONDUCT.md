# 🍕 Code of Conduct

Welcome to CodePizza. Let’s keep this simple and delicious.

## 🧠 The Golden Rule

**Don’t be a jerk.**  
That’s it. That’s the whole code.

If you’re contributing, discussing, or participating in any way — act like a reasonable human being.

---

## 🤝 What This Means

- Be respectful, even if someone’s wrong (especially if it’s you).
- Don’t harass, spam, troll, or otherwise act like an internet gremlin.
- Keep political, social, and identity debates out of this pizza oven.
- This is not a therapy group, HR department, or town hall meeting. It’s a codebase.

---

## 🚫 What We Don’t Do

- Weaponized empathy or performative outrage
- DEI buzzword bingo
- Committees, appeals, or vibe tribunals
- Tone policing disguised as feedback

---

## 🛠️ Enforcement

If you're making the space worse for others, you may be removed. No appeals. No Slack threads. No drama.  
The maintainers reserve the right to enforce this code however they see fit, including telling you: "Hey, maybe not."

---

## 🍕 In Summary

CodePizza is a space for:

- Builders, tinkerers, weirdos, and experimenters
- Coders who like things cheesy and low-stress
- Adults who can handle occasional internet nonsense without melting down

If that sounds like you, welcome. Pull up a slice.

If not — there are plenty of other places on GitHub that might be more your style.

Stay saucy. Stay civil. Let’s make cool stuff.
