## 🧠 What is Code Pizza?

**Code Pizza** is a quirky, developer-friendly brand celebrating the casual, chaotic joy of coding and comfort food.

It’s a:
- 🎉 Creative outlet  
- 🌐 Community & content hub  
- 💡 Open-source playground for devs who write bugs by day and eat pizza by night

You bring the code, we bring the cheese.
