# 🧠 Code Review Guide

> _“A good review makes the code better. A great review adds pineapple mode.”_

## 🧩 What to Look For

### ✅ Does It Work?
- Does the code run, build, or render?
- Are any features broken by this change?
- Is the intended feature *actually* implemented?

### 📦 Is It Scoped?
- Does the PR focus on one clear thing?
- Are there unrelated changes bundled in?

### 🧠 Is It Clear?
- Are function and variable names understandable?
- Is there a short explanation in the PR or code comments?
- Are any new files or directories logically named and placed?

### 🧽 Is It Clean?
- Obvious dead code or debug logs removed?
- No `asdfasdf()` functions or commit messages like “fix again lol”
- Bonus: Are there tests? (Not required, but delicious)

## 🍍 Pineapple Check (Bonus Round)

> These aren’t required, but they make us smile.

- Does it reflect CodePizza’s playful, weird, or creative spirit?
- Is it fun, well-branded, or a little unhinged (in a good way)?
- Did the contributor add a pizza pun or commit flair?
